# food-taste
a set of triplets (A, B, C) representing human annotations: the human annotator judged that the taste of dish A is more similar to the taste of dish B than to the taste of dish C


for each triplet (A, B, C) in test_triplets.txt you should predict 0 or 1 as follows:

1 if the dish in image A.jpg is closer in taste to the dish in image B.jpg than to the dish in C.jpg

0 if the dish in image A.jpg is closer in taste to the dish in image C.jpg than to the dish in B.jpg
